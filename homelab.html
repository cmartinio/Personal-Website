    <h1>Homelab Description</h1>
    <p>
        My homelab is an Hyperconververge Infrastructure that seamlessly integrate high performance computing, high speed Networking and secure Enterprise grade storage solution.  thi powerful setup to support my virtualization needs and more. <br> It features a 64-core AMD EPYC CPU and 256GB of RAM, providing ample computing<br> power for running multiple virtual machines simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        For storage, I have integrated 2 HBAs (Host Bus Adapters) that are utilized for disks <br>passthrough to the virtualized TrueNAS. This allows me to efficiently manage and store<br> my data across various virtual machines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I have incorporated 2 Mellanox NICs (Network Interface Cards) into my homelab setup.<br> One of the NICs, a 40GB card, is directly connected to the TrueNAS for high-speed data transfers.<br> The other NIC, a Mellanox ConnectX-4, is connected to the ESXi 8 hypervisor, enabling fast and<br> reliable network connectivity for virtual machines.
    </p>
