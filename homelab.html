    <p>
        My homelab is an Hyperconververge Infrastructure that seamlessly integrate high performance computing, <br>high speed Networking and secure Enterprise grade storage solution.  thi powerful setup to support my virtualization needs and more. <br> It features a 64-core AMD EPYC CPU and 256GB of RAM, providing ample computing<br> power for running multiple virtual machines simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        For storage, I have integrated 2 HBAs (Host Bus Adapters) that are utilized for disks <br>passthrough to the virtualized TrueNAS. This allows me to efficiently manage and store<br> my data across various virtual machines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I have incorporated 2 Mellanox NICs (Network Interface Cards) into my homelab setup.<br> One of the NICs, a 40GB card, is directly connected to the TrueNAS for high-speed data transfers.<br> The other NIC, a Mellanox ConnectX-4, is connected to the ESXi 8 hypervisor, enabling fast and<br> reliable network connectivity for virtual machines.

    <h2>VMWare Nested virtualization Lab</h2>
    <p>
   <h3>Nested ESXi virtualization and VMware NSX TLDR:</h3>
The homelab is running VMWare ESXi 8 hypervisor, which supports nested virtualization.<br> 
     
Nested virtualization refers to the ability to run a hypervisor inside of a virtual machine. In the context of VMware, <br>this is known as nested ESXi. This is particularly useful for testing and development environments where you can emulate a complete virtual system,<br> including the hypervisor, within a single physical host. This allows you to experiment with different configurations, <br> simulate different scenarios, and learn about ESXi without needing multiple physical machines.

<h3>Benefits of Nested ESXi:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cost-effective: You can set up multiple virtual ESXi hosts on a single physical machine, saving on hardware costs.</li>
    <li>Flexibility: You can easily create, modify, or remove virtual ESXi hosts as needed.</li>
    <li>Isolation: Changes made on a virtual ESXi host do not affect the physical host or other virtual hosts.</li>
    <li>Learning and testing: It's a great environment for learning about ESXi and testing configurations before deploying them in a production environment.</li>

<h3>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in VMware AKA NSX TLDR:</h3>
VMware's approach to SDN is primarily realized through VMware NSX. NSX virtualizes all networking layers (from L2 to L7) and<br> reproduces them entirely in software, decoupling the network functions from the underlying hardware. This allows for highly flexible and scalable<br> network deployment and management within a virtualized environment.

In the context of a nested ESXi environment, <br> SDN allows for the creation of complex network topologies within the nested<br> infrastructure. The traffic between virtual machines, even those on separate virtual ESXi hosts, can be entirely contained within the physical host. <br> This is achieved by virtualizing the network components such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc., allowing for network<br> traffic to be routed and controlled entirely within the software, without ever leaving the physical host. This is beneficial for<br> testing and development, security, and isolation of network traffic.
       
    
    <h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
    <p>
        The homelab runs multiple virtual machines to support various projects and experiments.<br> These virtual machines are used for testing, development, and learning purposes.<br> Some of the virtual machines include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Windows Server 2022 : For Active directory</li>
        <li>Windows Server 2022: Sharepoint on premise</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        My homelab is an essential part of my learning and experimentation process.<br> It provides me with the necessary resources to test new technologies, develop new 
        skills, and work on various projects.<br> I guess you are asking yourselves but where is the Cybersecurity and penetration testing LAB? <br> Well this is 
        the penetration testing LAB, in the real world one works with real systems, not some purposely built<br> systems for testing. I built this environment with that idea 
        in mind. Sonetimes I invite my friends in the industry<br> the to try and hack the system, this helps me improve the security posture of the overl system. The powerful 
        setup,<br> high-speed network connectivity, and ample storage capacity enable me to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously<br> and efficiently manage my data. 
        This homelab setup has been instrumental in my professional growth and development,<br> allowing me to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry.
